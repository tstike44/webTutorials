## Data Persistence with Local and Server Storage

### Overview

In this unit, we are starting to work with data-persistence. We will cover client-side data storage (localStorage and cookies), as well as server-side storage (Firebase).

### Learning Objectives

  * Explain the key components of compelling web applications.
  * Conceptualize and build creative apps that rely on outside data sources. 
  * Assign tasks and resolve merge conflicts using Git and GitHub.
