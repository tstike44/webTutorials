## JavaScript / jQuery Review, Timers, Debugger, and Introduction to APIs and AJAX

### Overview

This week we will review JavaScript & jQuery fundamentals, as well as touch on timing events, debugger, and sample interview questions.

Also this week, we will be introducing students to the concept of APIs and the use of AJAX queries to retrieve and parse data in JSON formats. Throughout the week we'll be specifically working with the Giphy, OMDb, and New York Times APIs.

### Learning Objectives

* By the end of this unit, students will be able to:
  * Utilize timers to build JavaScript programs that execute functionality at various times.
  * Utilize web inspector to debug JavaScript and jQuery scripts.
  * Conceptualize problems and pseudocode a plan to break down and approach complex problems. 
  * Explain how APIs work.
  * Parse JSON data from remote APIs.
  * Use AJAX to update web apps with remote content.
  * Delegate tasks in collaborative settingsâ€”data, layout, styling and so on.

### Key Topics

* JavaScript / jQuery Review
  * Looping over array.
  * Conditional logic.
  * Querying the DOM.
  * Modifying the DOM.
  * Listening to and responding to user events.

* Timers
  * Using setInterval to run a function repeatedly at a given interval and setTimeout to delay a function execution by a given time period.

* Debuggers
  * Using chrome debugging tools to pause and step through execution of a program, inspect values, uncover and resolve bugs.

* Interview Questions
  * Introduction to common beginner JavaScript algorithm problems.
  * Pseudo coding to think through problems before implementing solutions.
  * Whiteboard interviewing practice.

* APIs
* JSON
* AJAX
