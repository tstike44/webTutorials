## Attendance
[Back to Course Guidelines](../../README.md#course-guidelines)

Attendance must be maintained at a **95%** rate. (You can miss **no more** than a total of **4 classes**.)


A total of **4 classes** may be taken remotely with *prior approval*.

Expectations for remote class:

* Consistent interaction with TAs on Slack throughout the durations of class time.

* Possible collaboration with other students if they, too, are attending remote.

* Completion of all classroom activities prior to class end.

This program is designed to be an in-person, collaborative learning experience and the expectation remains for students to be in class for all sessions. 

Remote session attendance (4 max) is being provided as an exception for students with *extreme circumstances*, where in-person attendance is not an option, but students wish to stay on track as much as possible. This allowance is not meant to replace being in the classroom.

Remote attendance during project not permitted as students are required to complete 100% of project work and project participation is required to meet graduation criteria.

Students must request to instructor in advance to be remote and be approved. Staff should review if students meet remote eligibility.


## Late Policy

If you didn't reach out ahead of time and let us know and you are exceedingly late, and big topics are missed (typically greater than ~30min late, but don't take that to mean exactly 30 minutes late is fine) you will be marked as absent.  Make sure to reach out ahead of time when you know you will be late so that we can schedule 1-on-1's to get you back on track.  Being late can affect not only you, but also the rest of the class if we are catching you up on topics missed at the start of class.  We take punctuality seriously.  This is a bootcamp, we move fast so you must be here for every minute you can.
