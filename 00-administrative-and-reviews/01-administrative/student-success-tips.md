# Student Success Tips

* These are the tips I have seen over the past cohorts that have helped students succeed

## DO's

* Do get sleep

    * If you don't sleep well you'll basically be absent even if you are in class, which is like missing a day of class!  Get sleep!

* Do take mental health seriously

    * Take breaks when needed, but make sure to come back after breaks

* Do remember why you took this class

    * Self motivation is what defines the successful student, use your motivation for taking this class as your motivation for working hard in this class, think about it every day.

* Do take charge of your learning

    * The instructor could do everything for you, but after the class you would then not be prepared for working.
    * Ask for help when you need it
    * Know where you are and where you want to be and communicate it
    * If you don't communicate with your instructional team, they will not be able to help you.

* Do read documentation on new technologies

    * This is a really good practice and is what you will do whenever you start using a new technology when on the job.

* Do google questions first, before asking instructor

    * This is the best practice for what it will be like on the job, the more often you do this first the more prepared you will be.

* Do turn in homework in any condition

    * Whatever the condition is, we will help you to make it better!
    * The homework lets us see where you are at and we can make recommendations for you on what to focus on after seeing your homework.

* Do show up to class early

    * If you show up early, you will definitely be on time
    * You can also ask questions before class to start your day off right.

* Do ask for whiteboarding problems

    * After we get through the javascript section, start asking for whiteboarding problems.  The instructor will tailor them to your skill level, so if they give you too hard of a problem, the next time an easier problem will be given.
    * This is the best practice for what will be on a job interview you can get, and the most successful students all did this and did this often.

* Do extra practice at home

    * Try code drills, or sign up for code challenge websites
    * Programmers often will challenge their skills through coding challenges even when on the job, because practicing code is like sharpening the knife of your brain. 

* Do take notes

    * Writing down topics in your own words is a great key to success, it means taking in information and being able to describe it in your own way.

* Do help others

    * The best way to learn is to teach someone else

* Do ask questions

    * Asking questions is very important.
    * Ask whatever question you have, probably 10 other people have the same question.
    * Ask the same question again if you still are struggling
    * Ask for help after or before class by asking for a 1 on 1

* Do ask for 1 on 1 meetings

    * Every student struggles on something, some more than others, whenever you feel like you are struggling schedule a 1 on 1 and we will set you up for success!

* Do ask for central services tutoring

    * If 1 on 1 help is not enough help, request central services tutoring to get you extra help outside of class

* Do come to Thursday Review sessions

    * We will typically run an online review session on Thursdays at 6:30pm, if you cannot make it we will record the session, you can also submit your questions ahead of time

* Do form study groups

    * The best way to learn is to teach someone else, but also the best way to go far is to go together, form study groups with similar minded students

* Do look at the homework before classes in that unit start

    * Activities are reverse engineered from homeworks so that students can build the homework using a lot from activities, if you know what the assignment is you will know what to be looking for during activities

* Do stay after class for office hours

    * You can ask any questions you ran into during the day, or schedule a 1 on 1 for more in depth help.

* Do have fun and be creative

    * Be creative on the homework in ways that lets you have fun programming.  I encourage creativity over all else, because that is how you can keep your interest in the subjects high!

## DO NOT's

* Do not give up

    * I will not give up on you, and no student who has worked with me has been left behind in this class, but if you give up, it's really hard to turn things around.  The key to this class and programming is persistance in the face of difficulty.

* Do not talk when the instructor is talking

    * if you need to talk to a TA about a question/problem you have, this is fine, but if you are going over the last activity, or still working on the last activity, this will put you behind!

* Do not quietly suffer

    * Communicate if you are not feeling good about the class
    * Ask for 1 on 1 meetings as needed
    * If you do not speak up, we may not know there is a problem.

* Do not say "I cannot ..."

    * Say instead "It is hard now, but I can keep trying ..."

* Do not compare yourself to others

    * There are usually other students that go at different paces
    * Focus on where you were yesterday and where you are today, have you learned something since then?

* Do not be late

    * This class moves insanely fast, if you are late, you will likely miss something that will put you behind for the entire day.

* Do not be absent

    * You can be absent, but being gone for 1 day is being gone for about 1/3rd of a topic, this is a lot of information to miss.
    * If you have to miss at least try to watch remotely, and actually watch remotely!
    * Watch the video later if you do miss
    * Schedule 1 on 1's if you do miss

* Do not plagiarize

    * Copying solutions never helps you as a student
    * In programming there's a difference between copying a function that helps you to achieve one part of your problem and copying an entire program that is the answer to the problem you were given.
    * If you are ever concerned you are plagiarizing come ask the instructional team
