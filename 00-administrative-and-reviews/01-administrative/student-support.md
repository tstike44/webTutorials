#### Tutoring Details
[Back to top](#student-support)

1) Reach out to our SSM to request Central Services Tutoring.

**Keep in mind any time zone differences. Please make sure to discuss it with your tutor.  This issue has created a few missed sessions in the past.**

**Sessions should be 45 minutes in length. Once a week via a video using google hangouts.**

2) At the end of each session discuss scheduling the next session.  

3) Both the tutor and the student are **required** to fill out an evaluation form after EACH session.  Data is very important to the ongoing success of Central Support.  **Every tutor assignment email has the link to the Studentâ€™s Evaluation Form.**

* **If a student No-Shows to a session, the student may not be eligible for tutoring in the future.**

* **If student needs to change the appointment communicate with your tutor immediately.**

Live Office Hours:

Every Class Day 45 minutes before class and 30 minutes after class to review course material

1:1 office hours are intended to get you un-stuck and back on track.
1:1 office hours are intended to review concepts in scope and sequence to the class material.

You may also ask for Whiteboarding practice after class (after we start the javascript section)

Whiteboarding practice is one of the best ways to be interview ready after this course.  We will work to make questions suited to your level of programming (making it easier next time if it was too hard, or adding new concepts if you are doing well)
